tunc: If I have a graph containing trafic capacities between cities. Can you find the maximum trafic capacity between two cities?

To find the maximum traffic capacity between two cities in a graph, you can use the **Maximum Flow** algorithm. One of the most common algorithms for this is the **Edmonds-Karp** algorithm, which is an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using BFS.

Here's a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:

1. Parse the graph from the input file.
2. Implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum flow between two cities.
3. Calculate and print the maximum traffic capacity.

Let's implement this in Python:

1. Parse the graph from the input file.
2. Implement the Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
3. Calculate and print the maximum traffic capacity.

Here's the code:

```python
import json
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def read_graph(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        graph = json.load(file)
    return graph

def bfs(capacity, source, sink, parent):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([source])
    visited.add(source)

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()

        for v in capacity[u]:
            if v not in visited and capacity[u][v] > 0:
                queue.append(v)
                visited.add(v)
                parent[v] = u
                if v == sink:
                    return True
    return False

def edmonds_karp(graph, source, sink):
    capacity = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            capacity[u][v] = graph[u][v]

    parent = {}
    max_flow = 0

    while bfs(capacity, source, sink, parent):
        path_flow = float('Inf')
        s = sink

        while s != source:
            path_flow = min(path_flow, capacity[parent[s]][s])
            s = parent[s]

        v = sink
        while v != source:
            u = parent[v]
            capacity[u][v] -= path_flow
            capacity[v][u] += path_flow
            v = parent[v]

        max_flow += path_flow

    return max_flow

def main():
    file_path = 'OCTO-Coding-Challenge-2024-Week-4-Part-2-test-input.txt'  # Change this to your input file path
    graph = read_graph(file_path)
    source = 'A'  # Change this to your source city
    sink = 'Z'    # Change this to your sink city

    max_traffic_capacity = edmonds_karp(graph, source, sink)
    print(f"The maximum traffic capacity between {source} and {sink} is: {max_traffic_capacity}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Make sure to replace `'OCTO-Coding-Challenge-2024-Week-4-Part-2-test-input.txt'` with the actual path to your input file, and set the `source` and `sink` variables to the cities you want to find the maximum traffic capacity between.

This code will read the graph from the input file, compute the maximum flow using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and print the maximum traffic capacity between the specified source and sink cities.
